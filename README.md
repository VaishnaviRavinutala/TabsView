Tabs
Using Android tab layout, we can display more than one screen in a single screen.
You can show the tabs below the app bar, and use the PagerAdapter class to populate screens "pages" inside of a ViewPager.
Tab Layout is basically a view class required to be added into the layout of our app to create sliding tabs.
you can create sliding as well as non-sliding tabbed activity by using Android tablayout.
