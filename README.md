Tabs
Using Android tab layout, we can display more than one screen in a single screen.
TabsView provides horizontal layouts to display Android tabs on the screen
You can show the tabs below the app bar, and use the PagerAdapter class to populate screens "pages" inside of a ViewPager.
Tab Layout is basically a view class required to be added into the layout of our app to create sliding tabs.
you can create sliding as well as non-sliding tabbed activity by using Android tablayout.
